Instructions to use the tidalheating branch
-------------------------------------------

Local installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. First, create and activate a conda environment (you can choose any name in place of "bilby-tidal"):

   ``conda create -n bilby-tidal python=3.10``

   ``conda activate bilby-tidal``

2. Install numpy<1.25, scipy<1.11 and contourpy<1.2 beforehand. At present more recent versions create conflicts. The order of installation of these packages is important.

   ``pip install "numpy<1.25"``

   ``pip install "scipy<1.11"``

   ``pip install "contourpy<1.2"``

3. Clone the repo (let's say in the home directory): 
   
   via https (works without ssh keys)

   ``git clone https://github.com/samanwaya-mukherjee/bilby.git`` 
   
   or via SSH 

   ``git clone git@github.com:samanwaya-mukherjee/bilby.git``

4. Enter and switch to the tidalheating branch:

   ``cd ~/bilby``

   ``git switch tidalheating``

5. Install dependencies:

   ``pip install -r requirements.txt``

   ``pip install -r gw_requirements.txt``

6. With an "editable install" of bilby, you won't have to install the package every time you make any change in the source repo. The package will be loaded directly from the source. For this, run:

   ``pip install -e .``

   With a normal installation instead, the package has to be reinstalled every time a source code change is expected to show up in the outputs. For this, run (and run this after every change): 

   ``pip install .``

   Each of these options has its pros and cons, and the user should make the choice considering their use case.

7. Test the installation:

   ``cd ~/bilby/examples/gw_examples/injection_examples``

   ``python htf2_check.py``


Installation in LDG clusters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For a cluster installation, *editable install is not recommended* as running jobs may take several days and the results may be inconsistent if the source code is changed during that period.

If the cluster is equipped with IGWN conda distributions (say, igwn-py310) and you choose to use that, you may follow these commands: 

``conda create -n bilby-tidal --clone igwn-py310``

``conda activate bilby-tidal``

``git clone https://github.com/samanwaya-mukherjee/bilby.git``

``cd ~/bilby``

``git switch tidalheating``

``pip install .``

This will override the already existing Bilby installation in the IGWN clone.

📌 **NOTE**: If you don't clone an IGWN environment and follow the above steps for a minimal installation in the cluster, you may also need to install `bilby_pipe <https://lscsoft.docs.ligo.org/bilby_pipe/0.3.12/index.html>`_ for job submissions: 

``conda install -c conda-forge bilby_pipe``
